      <description>Redis Hashes are maps between string fields and string values (key-value pair), so they are the perfect data type to represent objects.
It will be useful for store multiple data that come from an object such as Customer and inside Customer object we have their Name, Age, Address and other info.
Because Redis isn&amp;rsquo;t like some of the SQL or NO-SQL languages that will auto generate ID when we create the instance or model.</description>

      <description>Javascript is a single-threaded programming language in the sense that it can only process one statement or only one thing can happen at a time. However, when we have a large scale data coming from API. The program might just stop and wait until the data is fully received from the end point even there are bunch of pending code waiting to be executed right after the request.
This is where asynchoronous Javascript comes into play.</description>

There are few things that you might interested to know before you start following this tutorial which is send data via Fetch API and Backend Server with Golang.
I also use back and modified the previous layout for this example and serve in 127.</description>

      <description>Unlike array or linked list which are linear, Binary Search Tree (BST) is constructed in a non-linear form.
Each element inside the BST is called node. It has 2 information from the node which are the current value and pointer that pointing to the next node or their child node. Usually the very first node is known as ROOT and the following will be child node.
There are some rules about this algorithm that is the node pointing from left will be the smaller value node while the node pointing from the right will be the larger value node.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will have a simple comparison on the XMLHttpRequest code and Fetch API code.
XMLHttpRequest(XHR) objects are used to interact with servers, it uses the concept of AJAX where we can retrieve the data from a URL or backend without having to do a full-page refresh.
In this case, I will be using JSON object as my Request Payload. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna something like this. 1var jsonObj = {}; 2jsonObj.</description>
